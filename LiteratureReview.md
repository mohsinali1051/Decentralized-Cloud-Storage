Decentralized is a term used to describe a system that is not owned or controlled by a single entity, such 
as a government, bank, or company. Instead, the product or service is run and maintained using the computing power
contributed by a global network of participants. 
In a decentralized market, various digital and technological devices are used by investors to communicate directly with other investors. This allows bid and ask prices to be displayed in real time, so dealers, buyers, and sellers don’t have to be in the same location to handle transactions.
Now let us discuss what is cloud computing. It is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage ( cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.

##### So what is decentralized cloud computing?

The decentralized cloud computing model promises to support scalable applications while retaining the safeguards of a decentralized, trust-minimized ecosystem. Decentralization means that the system does not rely on centralized servers or data centers, so there can be no single point of failure.
The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum. During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network.

Feeding all relevant inputs to a central solver is the obvious way to tackle a problem, but it's not always the only way. Decentralized methods that make do with only local communication and local computation are sometimes the best way. This episode of Drill Bits reviews an elegant protocol for self-organizing wireless networks that can also solve a seemingly impossible social networking problem. The protocol preserves privacy among participants and is so simple that it can be implemented with pencil, paper, and postcards. Example software implements both the decentralized protocol and a centralized solver.

Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in the field of information systems. In this paper, we conduct a citation and co-citation analysis on cloud computing research published in the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. A total of 214 papers were selected from 20 leading academic journals in IS and management and 2 prominent international IS conferences for our analysis. In the citation analysis, we rely on the degree centrality and betweenness centrality to identify 41 important papers. In addition, our main path analysis reveals three development stages of cloud computing research: the incubation stage, the exploration stage, and the burgeoning stage. In the co-citation analysis, we employ a principal component factor analysis of the co-citation matrix to identify six major research themes: foundations, SaaS model, security and risk, literature review, adoption and impacts, and modeling. This is among the first studies to examine the knowledge structure of cloud computing research in the IS discipline by using evidence-based analysis methods. Recommendations for future research directions in cloud computing are provided based on our analysis.

For all of its plus points, cloud computing has one or more disadvantages. There’s a single point of failure when the provider goes offline. The ability to censor or mask content and no real economic incentive to reduce prices.

There is one differentiation in the current centralized servers for cloud storage that decentralized blockchain-powered cloud storage makes redundant. In the current centralized landscape of ’public cloud‘ and ’private cloud’, both use the technology framework of cloud computing. 
However, the public cloud is a multi-tenant environment where the cloud storage service provider stores massive amounts of data from many individuals and businesses, whereas the private cloud is designed for a single organization. 
In a decentralized cloud solution like Storj, this differentiation isn‘t relevant. This is because the service provider or any storage node on the network is unable to access any of the content on the network.
Everything is encrypted, and as only shards of data are stored by farmers and not the entire file, there is no way they can access the data. 
The blockchain start-up Storj Labs has already built a blockchain-powered decentralized cloud storage network and so has assumed a leadership position in this exciting new market.
They have also built a platform comprising of open-source tools, and developers can use it to build their own decentralized cloud storage network.
While their number of active daily users remains small, this is one of the most promising decentralized cloud storage networks around.

As technologies change, challenges increase. Companies could not keep up with the pace of technology and the burst of data, and they started moving to the cloud. They then moved to multicloud and now a perimeter-less world to keep up with infrastructure and security as well as to keep costs low. The challenges are still pertinent; a critical app on one of the clouds going down can cause irreparable damage to the company, which could result in a possible loss of revenue as well as attract potential lawsuits. In addition, security, data privacy and central authority remain a concern. Some ERPs, especially financial systems, are run on-premises for privacy and security concerns.
The challenges listed above are not limited. Infrastructure is still concentrated, and we have a petabyte/exabyte worth of data coming in at scale and speed. This needs a modern architecture and a modern approach.
Enter the world of Web 3.0, a.k.a. semantic (read-write-execute) web apps that can connect with each other, exchange data, execute and understand your persona better. They can provide better recommendations, become intelligent with the help of AI and enrich the context even further.
Web 3.0 helps you own and define your own internet. Instead of companies, we now have decentralized autonomous organizations that work between creators and consumers, and they are defined by rules and assets owned by them rather than the companies — breaking the shackles of first-party data. Time will tell if this is the beginning of a truly data-driven enterprise. However, it has accelerated the rise of influencer/creator-led economies due to the challenges of Web 2.0.
Web 3.0 has led to the rise of distributed apps or decentralized apps (Dapps) where there will be no single point of failure and no central authority. They are transparent, have a greater level of encryption, have better heuristic methods to secure and are completely trustless. However, transparency brings compliance and liability into question. How will they be regulated? Who will a consumer report to if things go wrong? Where will justice prevail? Will this lead to anarchy?
This rise has already occurred in different areas, including payments (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot), storage (Storj, IPFS, Filecoin, RubiX Network), compute (Solana), enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger, Kaleido), social networks (STEEM, DTube, XR Sports) and play to earn (Axie).
Web 3.0 is still evolving. Most Dapps work on on-chain and off-chain concepts to address latency, and the throughput of the transactions is still evolving. Ownership of assets is still not completely on blockchain.
Trying to do a settlement on a Bitcoin or Ethereum can take up to 30 to 60 minutes, as the protocols are evolving from proof of work (POW) to proof of stake (POS), and the number of nodes that need consensus is serial in nature.

 Created by the same team responsible for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Filecoin is an open-source, cloud-based storage network that aims to improve upon some perceived shortcomings of traditional cloud storage providers. These pain points include insufficient trust, unreliable security, limited connectivity, poor scalability, and heightened dependency on centralized systems.
Filecoin’s goal is to build a huge decentralized file storage network that can be adapted to meet the varying needs of different customers. Low costs, fast retrieval speed, and data storage redundancy are a few of the modifications that may appeal to customers who choose to use Filecoin. Filecoin also claims to be built with state-of-the-art cryptographic storage proofs to ensure data is being stored securely and precisely for a specified time period.
The Filecoin system is built to create an incentivized structure for miners to accumulate as much storage space as possible so they can, in turn, rent that storage to customers. The system also relies on dedicated data retrievers who are responsible for retrieving requested data when clients call for it. In this way, storage and retrieval of decentralized data on the Filecoin protocol are linked directly to the mining mechanism of the entire system — and are separated into two distinct components. The retrieval market exists off-chain, while the storage market is built on-chain.

Web 3.0 Activities
In terms of how much of the datasphere and cloud is tied to Web 3.0 activities -- it seems to still be very early days. For example, she says, cryptocurrency trades might not represent a lot of data, but once NFT commerce includes big objects, it can require distributed-style storage. Options for such storage include IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Litan says, which is a peer-to-peer network data storage in a distributed system, as well as value-added systems such as Arweave, which make IPFS more reliable, secure, and persistent.
There are still some functional concerns that might hold developers or organizations back from leveraging distributed systems. “The reason why you’d want to use decentralized computing is if you’re setting up your own node or if you’re writing applications that need compute power,” Litan says.
Some benefits of turning to a decentralized cloud include it can be a way to cut costs, she says, rather than be at the whims of a centralized party that can increase rates, own the user’s data, and keep them locked in place. “It’s very hard to move workloads from one cloud provider to another,” Litan says. “It’s certainly a nice innovation.” Yet such innovation has been talked about for years, she says, with uncertain progress being made.

Decentralized Cloud
Basically, the value of decentralized cloud in its current form boils down to the circumstances and needs of the users. “If you’re setting up a mining node and need some cloud power, why would you want to pay AWS?” Litan asks. A decentralized cloud might be cheaper to run in such cases, she says, which appeals to miners who want cheap computing in order to make money on the margins.
At the moment, when many developers write applications, they look to the most readily available cloud service, Litan says, and then wind up deploying on the main blockchain where there is no control over where Ethereum or Bitcoin run. “It’s like saying, ‘Where’s the internet running?’”
There is some possibility for blockchain and decentralized cloud to gain more momentum down the road, but for now their impact on the entirety of cloud computing remains rather niche. “It may become more important as people start writing compute-intensive workloads and they want to keep the cost down,” Litan says. Decentralized cloud computing may also be useful for organizations running non-blockchain applications, she says. “Then they control their environments, where they deploy, and how much they spend. They’re in control of the whole stack.”

I. Saving files on blockchain servers
The system working has three stages, i.e., file encryption, file splitting, and file distribution. Let’s discuss them all in detail:

File encryption
Whenever you upload data to the server, every bit of your file gets automatically encrypted for its security and privacy. The part of your files gets decrypted when you submit a request for data access on that blockchain server without needing any private keys or specific permissions. Different servers use their own preferred encryption/decryption methods for file storage and access.

File splitting
After the file encryption, the data gets split into smaller pieces, and each piece is non-recognizable from another piece. Each file object comes into 80 pieces, and each piece saves in separate computers at different locations. For accessing these encrypted files, a minimum of 29 parts of that file get split. Splitting makes it secure as no one can access that file without the owner’s permission.

File distribution
The file is now ready to be distributed globally after its encryption and splitting. That means users’ entire files will not be on a single system. The blockchain network chooses the nodes for the file distribution, making the user’s file even more secure.

#### Gap 

There are three major challenges that stand in the way of the widespread adoption of decentralized cloud storage. Decentralized cloud storage scatters data across multiple cloud storage devices in a variety of places. Some organizations are reluctant to use the technology because of the problems it could cause.
