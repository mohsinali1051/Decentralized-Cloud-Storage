Decentralized is a term used to describe a system that is not owned or controlled by a single entity, such 
as a government, bank, or company. Instead, the product or service is run and maintained using the computing power
contributed by a global network of participants. 
In a decentralized market, various digital and technological devices are used by investors to communicate directly with other investors. This allows bid and ask prices to be displayed in real time, so dealers, buyers, and sellers don’t have to be in the same location to handle transactions.
Now let us discuss what is cloud computing. It is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage ( cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.

##### So what is decentralized cloud computing?

The decentralized cloud computing model promises to support scalable applications while retaining the safeguards of a decentralized, trust-minimized ecosystem. Decentralization means that the system does not rely on centralized servers or data centers, so there can be no single point of failure.
The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum. During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network.

Feeding all relevant inputs to a central solver is the obvious way to tackle a problem, but it's not always the only way. Decentralized methods that make do with only local communication and local computation are sometimes the best way. This episode of Drill Bits reviews an elegant protocol for self-organizing wireless networks that can also solve a seemingly impossible social networking problem. The protocol preserves privacy among participants and is so simple that it can be implemented with pencil, paper, and postcards. Example software implements both the decentralized protocol and a centralized solver.

Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in the field of information systems. In this paper, we conduct a citation and co-citation analysis on cloud computing research published in the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. A total of 214 papers were selected from 20 leading academic journals in IS and management and 2 prominent international IS conferences for our analysis. In the citation analysis, we rely on the degree centrality and betweenness centrality to identify 41 important papers. In addition, our main path analysis reveals three development stages of cloud computing research: the incubation stage, the exploration stage, and the burgeoning stage. In the co-citation analysis, we employ a principal component factor analysis of the co-citation matrix to identify six major research themes: foundations, SaaS model, security and risk, literature review, adoption and impacts, and modeling. This is among the first studies to examine the knowledge structure of cloud computing research in the IS discipline by using evidence-based analysis methods. Recommendations for future research directions in cloud computing are provided based on our analysis.

For all of its plus points, cloud computing has one or more disadvantages. There’s a single point of failure when the provider goes offline. The ability to censor or mask content and no real economic incentive to reduce prices.

#### Gap 

There are three major challenges that stand in the way of the widespread adoption of decentralized cloud storage. Decentralized cloud storage scatters data across multiple cloud storage devices in a variety of places. Some organizations are reluctant to use the technology because of the problems it could cause.
