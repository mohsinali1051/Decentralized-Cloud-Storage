Decentralized is a term used to describe a system that is not owned or controlled by a single entity, such 
as a government, bank, or company. Instead, the product or service is run and maintained using the computing power
contributed by a global network of participants. 
In a decentralized market, various digital and technological devices are used by investors to communicate directly with other investors. This allows bid and ask prices to be displayed in real time, so dealers, buyers, and sellers don’t have to be in the same location to handle transactions.
Now let us discuss what is cloud computing. It is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage ( cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.

##### So what is decentralized cloud computing?

The decentralized cloud computing model promises to support scalable applications while retaining the safeguards of a decentralized, trust-minimized ecosystem. Decentralization means that the system does not rely on centralized servers or data centers, so there can be no single point of failure.
The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum. During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network.

The natural approach to solving a problem is to pass all pertinent inputs through a central solver, however this is not necessarily the best approach. Sometimes the ideal approach is to use decentralised techniques that rely solely on local computation and communication. This Drill Bits episode examines a sophisticated self-organizing wireless network protocol that can also resolve a seemingly unsolvable social networking issue. The protocol protects participant privacy and is so straightforward that it can be carried out using just a pencil, paper, and postcards. The decentralised protocol and centralised solver are both implemented using an example piece of software.

One of the most popular subjects in the world of information systems is cloud computing. In this study, we analyse cloud computing research that was published throughout the course of an 11-year period, from 2004 to 2014. 20 prestigious academic journals in IS and management, as well as 2 important international IS conferences, contributed a total of 214 papers to our investigation. We use the degree centrality and betweenness centrality in the citation analysis to pinpoint 41 key papers.Additionally, our primary path analysis identifies three phases of cloud computing research development: incubation, exploration, and booming. We use a main component factor analysis of the co-citation matrix in the co-citation study to pinpoint six key areas of research: foundations, SaaS model, security and risk, literature review, adoption and impacts, and modelling. This is one of the first studies to use evidence-based analysis techniques to investigate the knowledge structure of cloud computing research in the IS discipline. Based on our findings, suggestions for future cloud computing research directions are given.

For all of its plus points, cloud computing has one or more disadvantages. There’s a single point of failure when the provider goes offline. The ability to censor or mask content and no real economic incentive to reduce prices.

Decentralized blockchain-powered cloud storage eliminates one distinction from the current centralised cloud storage servers. Both the "public cloud" and the "private cloud" in the present centralised landscape employ the cloud computing technology framework.
However, the private cloud is made for a single organisation, but the public cloud is a multi-tenant environment where the cloud storage service provider keeps enormous amounts of data from numerous individuals and enterprises.
This distinction is irrelevant on a decentralised cloud platform like Storj. This is due to the fact that neither the service provider nor any network storage node can access any network content.
Everything is encrypted, and since farmers only save fragments of the file—not the complete thing—there is no way for them to access the data.
the emerging blockchain firm With the creation of a decentralised cloud storage network driven by blockchain, Storj Labs has already established itself as a market leader.
Developers can use the platform they have created, which is made up of open-source tools, to create their own decentralised cloud storage network.
This is one of the most promising decentralised cloud storage networks available, even though the number of active daily users is still small.

Challenges grow as technologies advance. Companies began migrating to the cloud as a result of their inability to keep up with the pace of technology and the flood of data. In order to maintain infrastructure, security, and cost-effectiveness, they later migrated to multicloud and are currently operating in a perimeter-less environment. The issues still exist; the failure of a crucial cloud-based programme might leave a business permanently damaged, potentially losing out on revenue and opening itself up to legal action. Security, data privacy, and central authority are still issues. For reasons of security and privacy, some ERPs, particularly financial systems, are operated on-premises.
The difficulties mentioned above are not exclusive. We continue to have a focused infrastructure and fast, massive data inflow on the order of petabytes and exabytes. This requires contemporary design and thought.
Introducing Online 3.0, also known as semantic (read-write-execute) web apps that can communicate with one another, share data, run, and better understand your persona. With the use of AI, they may make better recommendations, develop intelligence, and further enliven the setting.
You may control and define your own internet thanks to Web 3.0. We now have decentralised autonomous organisations working between artists and consumers that are defined by their own rules and assets rather than the companies, breaking the chains of first-party data. If this is the start of a really data-driven organisation, only time will tell. Due to the difficulties of Web 2.0, it has, nonetheless, hastened the emergence of influencer/creator-led businesses.
Decentralized apps (Dapps), or distributed apps, have become more popular as a result of Web 3.0 since they lack a central authority and a single point of failure. They are entirely trustworthy, transparent, and have higher levels of encryption and heuristic security.Transparency, though, calls compliance and responsibility into question. Which rules will apply to them? To whom will a customer complain if something goes wrong? Where shall justice reign supreme? Will chaos result from this?
Payments (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot), storage (Storj, IPFS, Filecoin, RubiX Network), computation (Solana), enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger, Kaleido), social networks (STEEM, DTube, XR Sports), and play to earn (XR Sports) are just a few domains where this surge has already taken place (Axie).
Web 3.0 is still in its infancy. To combat latency, the majority of Dapps use on-chain and off-chain principles, and the transaction throughput is still developing. Asset ownership is still not entirely recorded on the blockchain.
Due to the evolution of the protocols from proof of work (POW) to proof of stake (POS), and the serial nature of the number of nodes that require consensus, attempting to settle on Bitcoin or Ethereum can take up to 30 to 60 minutes.

Filecoin is an open-source cloud-based storage network that was developed by the same team behind the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). It intends to address certain perceived drawbacks of conventional cloud storage providers. These problems include a lack of trust, shaky security, scant connectivity, inadequate scalability, and a greater reliance on centralised systems.
The objective of Filecoin is to create a sizable decentralised file storage network that can be customised to satisfy the various demands of various consumers. Customers that choose to utilise Filecoin may find the low prices, quick retrieval times, and redundant data storage to be some of the modifications that appeal to them. A further promise made by Filecoin is that it uses cutting-edge cryptographic storage proofs to guarantee that data is saved accurately and securely for a certain amount of time.
The Filecoin system is designed to provide miners with a financial incentive to amass as much storage space as they can, which they can then resell to clients. The system also depends on specialised data retrievers who are in charge of getting the data clients need when they call. In this approach, the Filecoin protocol's decentralised data storage and retrieval are divided into two different functions while yet being directly connected to the system's mining mechanism. While the storage market is created on-chain, the retrieval market is off-chain.

#### Web 3.0 Activities
It appears to still be extremely early in terms of how much the datasphere and cloud are connected to Web 3.0 activities. She gives the example of cryptocurrency exchanges, which may not involve a lot of data, but when NFT commerce involves large objects, it may need distributed storage. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network data storage in a distributed system, and value-added systems like Arweave, which increase IPFS' dependability, security, and persistence, are two options for this kind of storage, according to Litan.
Developers or organisations may still be hesitant to use distributed systems due to a few functional issues. Decentralized computing is advantageous "whether you're setting up your own node or if you're creating applications that need computational power," according to Litan.
Instead of being subject to the whims of a centralised company that can raise prices, possess the user's data, and lock them in place, she claims that switching to a decentralised cloud has certain advantages, such as the potential to reduce expenses. Moving workloads from one cloud provider to another is quite difficult, according to Litan. It is undoubtedly a good innovation. However, she claims that despite years of discussion, little real progress has been made in this area.

#### Decentralized Cloud
Essentially, the circumstances and requirements of the users determine the value of decentralised cloud in its current form. "Why would you want to pay AWS if you're building up a mining node and need some cloud power?" Litan queries. According to her, a decentralised cloud may be less expensive to operate in these circumstances, appealing to miners who need affordable computing to generate supplemental income.
According to Litan, many developers currently look to the most accessible cloud service when writing applications, which leads them to deploy on the main blockchain, where there is no control over where Ethereum or Bitcoin run. In other words, "where is the internet running?"
Blockchain and decentralised cloud may eventually acquire more traction, but for the time being, their influence on the overall cloud computing industry is still rather limited. It might become increasingly crucial as more people write workloads that are compute-intensive and cost-conscious, according to Litan. Using decentralised cloud computing may be advantageous for businesses using non-blockchain applications, according to her. Then they have control over their spending, deployment locations, and surroundings. They have control over the entire stack.

I. Saving files on blockchain servers
The system working has three stages, i.e., file encryption, file splitting, and file distribution. Let’s discuss them all in detail:

#### File encryption
Every piece of your file is automatically encrypted for protection and privacy as you submit data to the server. When you submit a request for data access on that blockchain server without requiring any private keys or certain permissions, a portion of your files are automatically decrypted. For file storage and access, different servers utilise their own preferred encryption/decryption techniques.

#### File splitting
The data is divided into smaller pieces after file encryption, and each piece is unrecognisable from the previous one. Each file object is divided into 80 pieces, each of which is saved on a different computer at a different place. A minimum of 29 pieces of the encrypted file must be divided in order to access it. As no one can access that file without the owner's permission, splitting it makes it secure.

#### File distribution
After being separated and encrypted, the file is now prepared for international distribution. This implies that all of a user's files will not reside on a single system. The user's file is much more secure because the blockchain network selects the nodes for file distribution.

#### Gap 
Decentralized cloud storage is currently not as widely used as it should be for three main reasons. Data is dispersed over numerous cloud storage systems located in various locations with decentralised cloud storage. Due to potential issues, some businesses are hesitant to employ the technology.
