# Decentralized-Cloud-Storage

# Abstract
## <About/Objective >
Data storage is a necessary requirement for every firm to operate efficiently. The safe and secure storage of sensitive information is essential and therefore Decentralized storage is a solution necessary for the data needs of the modern day. 
## <Context/Problem>
This study is conducted after realizing the fact since centralized storage systems are insecure for storing sensitive data, decentralized data storage has become more common. Users don't need to be concerned about the security and privacy of their data when storing it on the decentralized storage system.
## <Method>
The data chunks are kept in blocks in a decentralized storage system, each protected by a different hash or a set of private-public keys which are distributed among various nodes or computers and the information is kept scattered across several sites in a decentralized storage system. This entire mechanism is based on Blockchain Technology to provide the essential greater data security. To expedite and ensure the security of data retrieval and storage, the decentralized system uses load balancing and data redundancy. As there are several copies of the data on multiple nodes or computers spread out across different regions, even if one of them stops functioning, there won't be any data loss. The load balancing mechanism optimizes the whole network and limits traffic that is concentrated in one area.
## <Result and Conclusion>
Decentralized cloud storage solves all of these problems by providing your data with the privacy and security of a personal computer while still making it globally accessible. It encrypts, splits, and distributes data over a global network of hosting computers which serve as a node. In a sense, it uses blockchain technology to let you to own multiple computers all over the world where you may store your data and access it from anywhere. Encryption guarantees the safety of your data, your data is not centralized, it is not susceptible to censorship, and it cannot be hacked since it is fully encrypted before being saved.
